# ILCC — web assembler & debugger for the LCC

Browser-based assembler, interpreter, and step debugger for the **LCC** (Low Cost Computer), the 16-bit teaching ISA from *C and C++ Under the Hood* used in SUNY New Paltz's computer-architecture course. Hosted at **https://hydra.newpaltz.edu/ilcc**.

Also serves the course software downloads (SSO) and a TA autograder (SSO + staff role).

Professors and registered TAs can manage **Lab Configuration** from their account menu: name a lab,
add instructions, choose and order textbook sources, and save it as a draft or
publish it. Signed-in students use the editor's **Import → Lab** option to open
published labs as commented `.a` tabs. Lab configurations live in SQLite;
migration `003_labs.sql` runs automatically when the server starts. Changes to a
lab affect subsequent imports and do not alter existing editor tabs.

Original textbook sources live in `client/src/data/textbook/`. When adding or
removing source files, update `server/src/textbookSources.json`, the API's filename
allowlist. The server tests verify that this list matches the bundled sources.
Faculty SSO affiliations automatically grant admin access. TAs must first be
added by an admin through the account menu → Staff, as with the autograder.

## Layout

```
client/   React 19 + Vite 8 + CodeMirror 6 (CSS Modules)
server/   Express 5 + ws — assembles/runs LCC in worker threads, SQLite, SSO-aware routes
server/src/web_ilcc/     the assembler + interpreter the app actually runs
server/src/reference/    vendored upstream interactive_lccjs (tests, docs) — not imported at runtime
```

## Run locally

```bash
nvm use            # Node 22 (.nvmrc)
cd server && npm ci && cp .env.example .env && npm run dev     # :3000
cd client && npm ci && npm run dev                              # :5173, proxies /api → :3000
```

Open http://localhost:5173. SSO-gated pages (downloads, autograder) need `X-Hydra-Email` / `X-Hydra-Roles` headers — in dev, set `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR=0.0.0.0/0` and add them with a browser extension, or run behind Traefik.

## Test

```bash
cd server && npm test            # vitest: routes, auth, grader, zip ingest
cd server && npm run test:lcc    # jest: assembler/interpreter suites ported from reference/
cd client && npm test            # vitest: hooks, editor, isa data
cd client && npm run test:e2e    # playwright: run/debug/share/tour/autograder flows
```

## Build & deploy

Single image: Vite builds the client, Express serves `client/dist` plus the API/WebSockets.

```bash
docker build --build-arg VITE_BASE=/ilcc/ -t ilcc .
```

Production deploy is done from the Hydra control node with `hydra-saml-auth/scripts/deploy-ilcc.sh` (buildah → containerd import → `kubectl set image`). Manifests live in `hydra-saml-auth/k8s/components/ilcc/`. See `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

## Environment

See `server/.env.example`. Identity is never read from cookies — Traefik's forward-auth injects `X-Hydra-User/Email/Roles`, which the server trusts only from `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR` with the matching `HYDRA_PROXY_SECRET`.

## WebSocket protocol

`/api/run` and `/api/debug` — see `server/src/routes/{run,debug}.js` headers for message shapes.

## Contributing

Work happens on `compsci-suny-newpaltz/ilcc`. Branch from `main`, open a PR; CI runs lint, unit, integration, build, audit, and Playwright. Upstream student branches are being hand-ported into this layout — see the closed PRs on `aidanod3/web_ilcc` for what landed where.
